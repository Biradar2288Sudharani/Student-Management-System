# 🎓 Student Registration / Information Management System
Hello 👋,
This is a simple **Python-based application** developed for managing student registration and storing student information.
The system allows the user (admin or staff) to **add, update, delete, reset, and view** basic student details such as:
- Student ID  
- Name  
- Roll Number  
- Department  
- Contact Information

- Address  
This project is especially useful for **beginners** who are learning:
- ✅ File handling in Python  
- ✅ Basic GUI development using Tkinter  
- ✅ Exception handling  
- ✅ Database operations (with MySQL)
---
